# Getting Started with Express Rider

This project was bootstrapped with React router. This project is about to share ride with bike, car, bus and train. If anyone hit any transport card, it will be open in new tab with that particular ride sharing tranport's information. 
You can visit that site from here... [Express Rider](https://express-rider.netlify.app/).
